Resources for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIMK8qmV41Y">CODXCRYPT session</a> 

## Getting started⚡
Give <a href="https://magazine.joomla.org/all-issues/may-2021/vs-code-use-it-like-a-pro">this</a> blog a read. Here I have written a 101 guide to VScode and helps while using GitHub.

### How to find issues⁉:-
- Learn some coding languages/frameworks. But in case you don't know, it's still okay. you can contribute and <code>learn on the go</code>
- find good first issues <a href="https://goodfirstissues.com/">here</a>

                          OR
- You can also find good first issues by Github Search.

> Paste this in the search
   <code>is:open is:issue no:assignee label:"good first issue" archived:false </code>
   
you can add additional parameter of <code>language:<LANGUAGE_YOU_KNOW></code>
example:    <code>is:open is:issue no:assignee label:"good first issue" archived:false <b>language:html</b> </code>

### How to get issues assigned🔗 
In most organisations, you are welcome to find an issue and send PR directly, but that is not a good practice. I prefer simple workflow <b>comment> commit> create PR</b>

 <b>COMMENT</b>:- comment on the issue of your interest and ask to be assigned for the issue. Issues are generally assigned on first-come-first-serve basis.
 
 <b>COMMIT</b>:- fork the repo, make changes, and <b>commit changes to new branch</b>. But why a new branch? the reason is simple. Suppose you are working on multiple issues, it gives flexibility. 
 
 <b>CREATE PR</b>:- now, set your branch to the new branch that have the changed codes. Click on contribute, compare and send a PR.
 
⚠ A NOTE FOR PR. 

kindly send a well documented PR and attach media whenever needed. If your PR solves an already existing issue, in your PR description, mention that issue by writing #{issue_id}.Issue id can be found in issue itself

#### wait for the repo owners to review your PR, and if it does the job, it will be merged!🎉

## Opensource events
1) Google Summer Of Code a.k.a GSOC
  
  <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSOC</a> is annual opensource event of google where students get chance to work with various organisations on guided projects. Aim of GSOC is to promote open-source culture. GSOC is dream of every open-source enthusiast and around 1300+ students are selected globally for a period of around 3 months.
On successful completion of projects, students receive handsome stipend. It's a great opportunity to work on real world projects and impact millions of users
  
2) Outreachy 
  
  <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a> is very similar to GSoC, with the main difference that is aimed at minorities, so it is mainly directed towards women and people whose minority is underrepresented in technology. The other difference is that it is held twice a year, while GSoC is only held once. Outreachy has less pool of money and selects less number of students as compared to GSOC, but the individual stipend is more than GSOC.
  
3) MLH fellowship
  
  The <a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/">MLH Fellowship</a> is an internship alternative for software engineers, with a focus on Open Source projects. Instead of working on a project for just one company, students contribute to Open Source projects that are used by companies around the world.
  it has 3 tracks:-
  - <a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/programs/open-source">Opensource track</a>
  - <a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/programs/software-engineering">Software engineering</a>
  - <a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/programs/production-engineering">Production engineer</a>

## ⚠ OPENSOURCE != MONEY/SWAGS/CERTIFICATES ⚠
  
  Many people are mistaken that Open-source is just about money/swags/certificates. I mean, yeah, they MIGHT be a small part of it, but NOT the everything of it! 
  When a person's first PR is merged, that feeling is way beyond all the materialistic things. No money can buy that comfort. The above mentioned prorgammes are a great opportunity , but if you apply for them <b>SOLELY FOR PERKS WHATEVER THEY MAYBE</b> , then you haven't understood open-source yet. Open-source is a feeling of JOY!. Imagine noobs, sending typo fixing PR (i also do it sometimes- <i>still</i>), and see it merge. They realise that their PR will affect so many people and they have contributed to something big. No contribution is small, You just need to do it with passion.
